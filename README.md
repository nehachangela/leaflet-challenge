Created the Earthquake Visualization 

First task was to visualize an earthquake dataset:
1.	Following steps were taken to extract data from USGS:\
*The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes.\
*Extracted a dataset of All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days provided in a JSON representation of the data.\
*Used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

4.	Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:\
*Using Leaflet, created a map layer and another layer that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.\
*Data markers were created to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.\
*Included popups that provide location, date/time and magnitude information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.\
*Finally, created a legend that will provide context for the map data.\
